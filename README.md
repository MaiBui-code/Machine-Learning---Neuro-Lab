# Machine-Learning---Neuro-Lab

This is the code I have been writing for my Neuroscience lab, in which we use Python to analyze the anatomy of Trachea System of Female Drosophilia. 
As the paper has not been officially published, the code has to be tranfered from Jupiter Notebook into a Python file. 
Thus, the visualization of the data will be missing and may make it hard to understand. When it is published, I will add more information, and the
technical terms (infiltration points, TLCs, ends, etc) for better clarification.
